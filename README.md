# vscode-urweb

This extension provides support for Ur/Web.

Right now, it is very basic but still, better than nothing! The ultimate goal is to provide support for the language server integrated in Ur/Web but we're not quite there yet. Any help is appreciated.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting for .ur files (very basic)

## Missing features

* Better syntax highlighting
* Language server integration

## Release Notes

**This extension is not yet published to the vscode marketplace.**
